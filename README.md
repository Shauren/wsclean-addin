WhitespaceCleaner AddIn for Visual Studio

This add-in removes trailing whitespace when a document is saved save and converts tabs to appropriate amount of spaces (specified by tab size config in the editor) if Visual Studio is configured to insert spaces instead of tabs (preferring the language that the document is in)
